    <section class="about">
			<h1>About Claire</h1>
			<p>Claire is a product for Drug Manufacturing Marketers in addition to the general public. It is designed for web and mobile interfaces. The system correlates Adverse Events for Drugs, consumed from FDA data sources, to positive and negative sentiments expressed on Twitter for that Drug. The results are aggregated by Drug and Manufacturer, and displayed in user-friendly  graphs. Claire may be used as an early warning system to:</p>
			<ul>
		    <li>Alert manufacturers to negative feedback about their Drug that may lead to reductions in sales</li>
		    <li>Inform the general public on drugs to avoid based on recalls and adverse events</li>
		    <li>Educate the general public on whether they should consider using a specific drug based on what other users are saying</li>
			</ul>
    </section>
    
    <section class="future">
			<h1>Future of Claire</h1>
			<p>We have many more ideas to incorporate into Claire given more time. They include the following:</p>
			<ul>
		    <li><b>Ingestion Framework</b> - Most likely we would choose something similar to Twitter Storm as our ingestion framework.  This would allow us to stream source data, then run custom business logic against it such as normalization and enrichment.</li>
		    <li><b>More data</b> - We would increase the amount of drugs and the timeframe of the data.</li>
		    <li><b>Ingest News</b> - Instead of just linking out to news articles, we would ingest them and run analysis against them.</li>
		    <li><b>ElasticSearch</b> - We would use a ElasticSearch as our data store.  That would allow the user to perform simple or advanced full text search against the OpenFDA data as well as Tweets and News articles.</li>
		    <li><b>Drill Down</b> - We would allow users to perform more drill down functionality within the drug screen. This would include changing the timeframe as well as viewing the individual events, tweets, and news articles.</li>
		    <li><b>Rankings Screen</b> - We would include a screen that focuses on each ranking and the drugs within. This would allow users to highlight and compare many drugs.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Our Process</h1>
			<p>We built this application in 3 two-day sprints, and a 15 minute scrum each morning. Considering the rapid turnaround for this project we relied heavily on our scrum board.</p>
			<p>We chose to camp out in one of our war rooms for the week. Following our roots in agile, we strive on working close together being able to collaborate real-time.</p>

			<h2>UI/UX</h2>
			<p>We started prototypoing via whiteboard sketches then moved rapidly into wireframes. We then created our hi-fidelity mockups and was able to iterate on those also. After finalizing our design we then defined our <a href="https://github.com/42sixsolutions/claire/raw/master/claire-ui/styleguide/StyleGuide%20-%20Claire%20-%20062615.pdf">styleguide</a> which will assist with future development of this application.</p>

			<h2>Technology Stack &amp; Architecture</h2>
			<p>Following our Interface Driven Development process we were able to rapidly decide on our stack and archietcture after visualizing our requirements.</p>
